JAS-39 Gripen built using Bovine74's Custom Aircraft Template (CAT) and updated to the new Steam modloader by me. Assetbundle and models are not included on here, this is just for building the mod DLL. Want to make a mod yourself? Join the VTOL VR Modding Discord server.

**Multiplayer** compatibility is **not yet confirmed** but might work, please tell me if you try!

The model isn't made by me, but heavily edited and "fixed" in some areas. Interior buttons and MFDs are taken from BCAT.

Includes a custom Litening TGP and External fuel tank (3500L).
