*Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Yes it is.*

**Multiplayer** compatibility is **not yet confirmed** but might work, please tell me if you try!

The model isn't made by me, but heavily edited and "fixed" in some areas. Interior buttons and MFDs are taken from BCAT.

Includes a custom Litening TGP and External fuel tank (3500L).

Not entirely bug-free.

- G-limit is a bit low, for now turn the G limiter off when turns are needed.
